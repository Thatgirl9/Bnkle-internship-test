# Blog Post üìù

The Blog Post is a landing page that displays a list of posts fetched from an API. When hovered it displays a **Learn More** text that presents a modal showing more information about the post like the Author's Image. It routes to an **Analytics** *(/analytics)* page, that tracks and shows how often a post has been clicked in a tabular form.

## Technologies Used ‚öô and Reference Links üîó.
- **Technologies**
- [Vite + React](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) - Used to create a React Application supporting Typescript.
- [React Routing](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial) - Used to implement React Routing to route through *(/home)* and *(/analytics)*.
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started) - Used to track the number of clicks of each post.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) + [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) - Used to implement testing.
- **Designs**

## Approach and Key Decisions in the Development Process üèó.

### 1.  Understanding Requirements.
  The first step involved understanding the project requirements. This includes undergoing the design specifications, application setup, responsiveness and dos and don'ts.

### 2. Planning and strategy.
  I planned how to approach the project that satisfied the requirements. 


### 3. Technology Selection.
I used technologies and tools based on project requirements and scalability. Key Decision: Using Redux-Toolkit over Context API, why? Redux is a JS library for maintainable global state management. Redux Toolkit is Redux's official recommended approach for writing its logic, it simplifies most Redux tasks, prevents common mistakes, and makes it easier to write Redux applications. I decided to use Redux-Toolkit in line with the project requirement because I wanted to expand my knowledge and improve my skills in it since I have little proficiency in it, subsequently, it is recommended for a bigger application. 

### 4. Testing.
Unit testing was implemented to ensure the application worked as expected.

### 5. Deployment.
I deployed using Netlify Pages to ensure reliability.

### 5. Documentation.
Complete documentation was created. This covers information about the Blog Post Application, the technologies and tools utilised, major approaches and key decisions taken during the development process, and instructions for running the Blog Post application.
